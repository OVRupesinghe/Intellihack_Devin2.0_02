# Intent Classification Model
This project hosts the code for an intent classification model using Support Vector Machines (SVM) and TF-IDF vectorization. The model is designed to classify sentences based on their intents from JSONL formatted text data. The repository includes a Python script that automates the training, testing, and evaluation of the model.

# System Requirements
Python 3.6+
pip (Python package installer)

# Dependencies
This project depends on several Python libraries which can be installed using pip. The required libraries are:
  pandas
  scikit-learn
  numpy
# Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository

cd Intellihack_Devin2.0_02

2. Install Required Libraries
  Ensure you have Python and pip installed on your system. Install the required Python libraries using:
    pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy
  Prepare Your Data
    Place your training data (train.jsonl) and testing data (test.jsonl) in the project directory or modify the script to point to the correct file locations.
   
3. Usage
  To run the intent classification model, execute the Python script from the command line:
  python intent_classification.py
